Task 2: Portfolio Website

I am excited to share the completion of Task 2: Portfolio Website as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte. A personal portfolio website is an essential tool for showcasing skills, projects, and professional experience, making it a valuable project for any web developer.

For this project, I designed and developed a fully responsive portfolio website using HTML and CSS, ensuring a structured and professional layout. The website includes a dedicated section for personal introductions, project showcases, skills overview, and contact information. Special attention was given to design consistency, smooth navigation, and accessibility across different devices.

This project not only enhanced my front-end development skills but also deepened my understanding of personal branding and user engagement. A well-crafted portfolio is an important step toward establishing a professional digital presence, and I look forward to further refining it as I progress in my career.
